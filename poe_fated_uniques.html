	<b>This sheet is only useful until you can run T2 maps reliably and have ~150c in the bank.</b><br>
	At that point map-running profits are far faster than trying to purchase/run prophecies.<br>
	You can compile 6-12 unidentified rare sets (or more) worth 2c each  in the time it takes to sell even one of these items, that's 12c-24c right there.<br>
	(Buy rings/amulets/belts for 1alc each in bulk, 12-24 at a time.)
	<br><br>
	<p><b>This calculator assumes 1c = 1c, 1 exa = 100c, and everything else = .1c</b><br>
	I know it's not exact, but it's close enough for you to see what makes sense to craft without having to do a shitload more coding. It's not worth the extra effort on the backend.
	<br><br>
	<b>This calculator is going by the lowest price for each item.</b><br>
	Be aware the resulting item may sell for even more than shown here, depending on the stat rolls your item gets or how many sockets you can put on it.
	<br><br>
	<b>Tip: Don't look at this tool expecting to buy from scratch. A better use of this tool is to check your drops and get familiar with these items.</b><br>
	This is faster because you get the item running maps (which means you're leveling) instead of messaging 20 people trying to buy it (which means you're not leveling).<br>
	When you get a unique drop check here to see if it's worth upgrading. Once you've upgraded it use the trade links here to check prices if you don't have the <a href="https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/List_of_Path_of_Exile_related_applications">Poe Trade Macro</a> installed.
	<br><br>
	<b>If you're flat broke and need to make some currency then PLEASE - DO NOT MAKE MULTIPLES OF THE SAME ITEM !!!</b><br>
	That makes everyone's prices go down, including yours.<br>
	Either pick 2-3 items and only make one of each or "go all in" and invest all your spare currency on one expensive item.<br>
	Just because there is a POTENTIAL profit doesn't mean anything if your item doesn't sell. Check <a href="https://poe.ninja/">poe.ninja</a> to check interest in the item.
